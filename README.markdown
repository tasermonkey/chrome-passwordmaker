The only thing that kept me from switching to chrome completly was a missing port of the <a href="http://passwordmaker.org/">passwordmaker.org</a>
extension. Luckily there was one available in the <a href="http://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/doblembglfahhpiilfhajboogopikhcm">extension directory</a>.
Sadly that extension is only a simple port of the html page that is offered on <a href="http://passwordmaker.org/">passwordmaker.org</a>.

This extension fixes this. It's a real port with all the bells and whistles you expect.

# Installation
