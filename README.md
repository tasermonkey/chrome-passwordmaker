# Chrome PasswordMaker Pro

![Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/4dhnDEK.png)

The only thing that kept me from switching to Chrome completely was a missing port of the [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/) extension. Luckily, there was one available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker/doblembglfahhpiilfhajboogopikhcm). Sadly, that extension is only a simple port of the HTML page that is offered on [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html).

This extension fixes that. It's a real port with all the bells and whistles you'd expect.
